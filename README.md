# Find Twitter Spaces

Welcome to the *Find Twitter Spaces* project, a dedicated search engine designed to enhance the accessibility and user experience of navigating Twitter Spaces. This project was built as a means to overcome the cumbersome search functionality of Twitter Spaces, providing users with a more streamlined, less spam-ridden alternative.

## :warning: Notice

The project was previously hosted on Replit. However, due to recent changes to Twitter's API policy, I am no longer able to provide live services. The policy changes restrict free API users from requesting Twitter Spaces data. Despite these unfortunate developments, this repository remains available for learning purposes and inspiration for similar projects.

## :gear: Functionality & Features

The project comes with several features designed for a better user experience:

- **Auto Query on Load:** On every page load, the application will automatically query and refresh the list of current Twitter Spaces, keeping you up-to-date.
- **Caching Feature:** User queries are employed to persistently update the server's list of Twitter Spaces, particularly those with the highest number of participants. This feature serves to ensure that users always have the most active Twitter Spaces at their fingertips.
- **Highest Participant Count Spaces on Top:** For better visibility and to ensure you do not miss out on the most happening spaces, those with the highest participant count are shown at the top of the list when you load the page.
- **Filter for Live and Planned Spaces:** With the added flexibility to filter for live and planned spaces, users have the power to view spaces according to their preferences and convenience.

## :bulb: Use Case

The "Find Twitter Spaces" project was developed considering the following challenges faced by Twitter users:

- **Searching Twitter Spaces is Inconvenient:** Often, there is a lot of spam which clutters the search results. Moreover, using search filter tags for refining the search is not a very user-friendly feature.
- **Relevancy of Spaces:** It's not easy to see the most relevant spaces, especially from users you don't follow.
- **Live Updates:** As more users join a Space, live updates ensure that the Spaces with lazy refreshes get more visibility. This scaling feature enhances the user's accessibility to the most active Spaces.

## :computer: Tech Stack

This application was built using the following tech stack:

- CSS: For styling the application.
- HTML: For structuring the web pages.
- JavaScript: For implementing interactive elements.
- JQuery: To simplify the HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation.

While I'm saddened by the discontinuation of live service due to the Twitter API policy change, I believe the project remains a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring a project that combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery in a real-world application.

If you're interested in the project, feel free to explore the code, replicate it, or adapt it for your projects as needed.
